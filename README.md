# Aurora-demos

This project contains the attack chains generated by Aurora, a cyberattack emulation system leveraging classical planning (PDDL) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

Aurora is a framework that can automatically construct multi-step cyberattacks (attack chains), set up emulation environments, and semi-automatically execute the generated attack chains. With the help of LLM, it makes use of external attack tools and threat intelligence reports.

We are preparing publishing the source code of Aurora.

## System Overview

<p align="center">

<img src="images/framework.png" alt="cli output" width="1000"/>

</p>


Aurora’s architecture comprises five components:

- `Attack Tool Analysis`: Converts third-party tool documentation into structured attack actions using rule-based and LLM-assisted predicate extraction.

- `Attack Report Analysis`: Extracts Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) from CTI reports via LLMs to guide attack planning.

- `Attack Planning`: Uses PDDL and reward functions (aligned with CTI-derived TTPs) to generate attack chains.

- `Attack Environment Builder`: Deploys pre-configured virtual machines to replicate vulnerable environments.

- `Attack Execution`: Semi-automatically runs attack scripts and collects traces for dataset construction.

## Attack Chains

This repo stores attack chains generated by Aurora, which can be found in the `examples/` folder. Each folder in `examples/` contains an attach chain, which includes the emulation plan details and attack steps.

For more details, please refer to the [introduction to attack chains](https://github.com/LexusWang/Aurora-demos/blob/main/docs/attack_chain_introduction.md).

## Usage
We show how to reproduce (execute) the generated attack chains in this section.

### 0. Dependencies
To execute the attack chains, you need to set up an attack machine that contains the necessary attack tools.
Specifically, we use [Attack Executor](https://github.com/LexusWang/attack_executor) to execute the attack actions provided by different attack tools.

Detailed configuration steps are documented in [Guide](./docs/attacker_environment_setup_guide.md).
Follow this guide to configure the attack machine for attack execution.

We’ve also prepared pre-configured attack machine for you! You can download and deploy it directly from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FCBZtsHM363eWor1xep4CzfNtMSio-RS/view?usp=drive_link).

### 1. Pull and deploy the attack emulation environments:
We deployed the attack machine in Step 0. 
We also need to set up the attack emulation environments (the victim machines).

Running `pull.py` on the attack chain YML file automatically downloads and deploys the corresponding victim virtual machines. (we use VirtualBox as the default virtualization software; VMware users can manually download and deploy the virtual machines).

``` bash
## Prohibiting duplicate deployment
python pull.py -p #yml_file_path -d #storage_path -vm #VBoxManage.exe_path --url_table #url_table_path -nr -firewall #yes/no
## Allowing duplicate downloads
python pull.py -p #yml_file_path -d #storage_path -vm #VBoxManage.exe_path --url_table #url_table_path -r -firewall #yes/no
```
- `yml_file_path`：The path of the attack chain yml file  
- `storage_path`：The storage path of the downloaded target machine file  
- `VBoxManage.exe_path`：The VBoxManage.exe path of VirtualBox is used for invocation  
- `url_table_path`：The path of the Download Link mapping table (url_table.csv)  
- `-nr`：Prohibiting duplicate deployment  
- `-r`：Allowing duplicate downloads  
- `-firewall`：Use pfSense firewall to isolate the attack aircraft and the target aircraft  

Notes:
- Two download modes are supported:
  - No duplication: If the VM image file already exists, it will prompt whether to directly proceed with deployment.
  - Allow duplications: VM image files will be automatically renamed to avoid conflicts.

- During initial deployment, the VM will not start automatically, allowing users to modify configurations.

- By default, two network adapters will be configured: one in NAT mode and the other in Host-only mode. Make sure the required network is configured in VirtualBox; otherwise, the VM may fail to start.


<!-- Example:If you don't want to allow repeated downloads of the attack chain "examples\access_encrypted_edge_credentials\attack_plan.yml" corresponding to the range. You can use  -->
Example: If you want to deploy the emulation environments of the attack chain "examples\access_encrypted_edge_credentials\attack_plan.yml", you can use
``` bash
python pull.py -p examples\access_encrypted_edge_credentials\attack_plan.yml -d download -vm C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\\VBoxManage.exe --url_table docs\url_table.csv -nr -firewall no
```
If the VM image file has been downloaded before, it will display:<p align="center">

<img src="images/No_repeat.png" alt="request" width="1200"/>

</p>
Entering "yes" will directly start the corresponding virtual machine.
On the contrary, if duplication is allowed, the VM image file will be redownloaded and renamed to avoid conflicts.


<!-- ``` bash
python pull.py -p examples\access_encrypted_edge_credentials\attack_plan.yml -d download -vm C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\\VBoxManage.exe --url_table docs\url_table.csv -nr -firewall yes
``` -->
Besides, if you want to use firewall for isolation. Just set `-firewall` as `yes`. 
<!-- If it was not downloaded originally, firewall.ova will be automatically downloaded. If there is already a download, it will skip and ask if you want to start it. -->

When using pfsense, the configuration interface is as follows:
<p align="center">

<img src="images/pfsense.png" alt="pfsense set" width="1200"/>

</p>
Therefore, two corresponding host-only network cards need to be set up in VirtualBox in advance. Meanwhile, it is recommended to turn off the NAT network card.


Special virtual machine download：In addition to the target machine information that can attack the chain file reading, we have also prepared an attack machine (Parrot) virtual machine, as well as an Ubuntu and MacOS target machine. To download these three virtual machines, you just need to enter in -p. 

For example:
``` bash
python pull.py -p attacker/Ubuntu/macos -d download -vm C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\\VBoxManage.exe --url_table docs\url_table.csv -nr
```

#### Attack emulation infrastructure

Attackers: Kali,Windows 10<br> DNS_server: Debian<br> Firewall: pfSense<br> Victims：Windows 10,macOS,Ubuntu<br>

You can visit this [doc](https://github.com/LexusWang/Aurora-demos/blob/main/docs/Emulation_Infrastructure_info.md) to view more detailed information about the simulation environment.

### 2. Generate attack scripts:

The logic of the script is to configure itself based on the `executor` provided in the `attack_plan.yml`. The script reads `command` and `arguments` by determining the type of `executor` specified. Additionally, it explicitly extracts `arguments` marked as `Required: true` from the `exploit` and `payload` sections of the file and outputs them directly into the executable script. This design simplifies user configuration and minimizes manual intervention. After executing this script, users will obtain a large number of ready-to-run attack scripts, streamlining the setup process and saving operational time

``` bash
python generateExecution.py
```

### 3. Execute attack scripts:

We've generated executable attack scripts with AURORA and placed them in [here](https://github.com/LexusWang/Aurora-demos/tree/main/attack_execution_scripts) .Once your environment is configured, simply open the console, run the scripts, and follow the on-screen instructions to execute the attack.

```bash
python ../results/execution_xxxx.py
```

<details>
<summary>EXAMPLE-1_execution_keyboard_input_simulated-3</summary>

This attack plan uses `Metasploit` and `Sliver` tools to compromise Windows systems. First, a listener is established to capture incoming connections. A malicious `Sliver` payload is then created and delivered by tricking the victim into downloading/running it, granting remote access. Finally, this access is leveraged to deploy a stealthy `Meterpreter` payload via `Sliver` for data exfiltration (`keyboard input simulation`)

<details>
<summary>EXAMPLE-2_execution_file_info_known-1</summary>

This attack simulation targets Windows systems using `Sliver` and `Metasploit`. It starts by creating a `Sliver` implant (malicious.exe) and tricking the victim into downloading/running it as Administrator. This grants attackers an elevated `Sliver` C2 session. Next, a `Metasploit` listener is set up to catch a reverse HTTPS payload ("meterpreter_reverse_http") deployed through `Sliver`, enabling a stealthy `Meterpreter` session. Finally, attackers use `Meterpreter` to search for sensitive files (like *.txt) on compromised machines.
